Validation
By Preston Price

This week I went out of my way to validate people. I am normally
good at validating my wife, so that one was easy, but I made sure
to validate her for things that I normally wouldn't. I also validated one of my friends who invited me over to his house. I told him how great his house was and how it was so cool that he had us all at his house and he seemed to feel very good. I also made sure to validate people in my classes when they would help me by assuring them that they were a lot of help and that I was thankful for their time.
