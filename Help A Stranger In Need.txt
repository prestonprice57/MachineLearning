Help A Stranger In Need

To be honest, it was very hard to find a stranger to help this week. I'm in the same boat as Brother Burton where I go to school and interact with people there and come home and just mostly interact with my wife. I do things with my friends but I normally don't go out of my comfort zone to meet anyone new.
This week I decided to help a stranger by not being a stranger. I went out of my comfort zone and decided to befriend strangers that I normally would not have. It might have helped me more than it helped them, but I was glad that I took on this challenge and decided to be a little more outgoing.
