For each of the following questions, indicate "True" or "False" on the line after the question.

2. A data structure is created to hold a node (a.k.a. neuron)
True

3. A set of input weights is stored for each node.
True

4. A layer of nodes (of any number) can be easily created.
True

5. Bias input is accounted for in each node.
True

6. Input can be taken for an actual dataset instance (e.g., Iris) and each node in the layer produces the appropriate value (0 or 1) according to its weights.
