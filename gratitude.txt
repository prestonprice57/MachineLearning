This week I was able to show my gratitude for the Lord. I feel like it is a very easy thing in your prayers to be
thankful for all of the blessings we receive but we forget to thank the Lord personally for just being there for
us and helping us out day to day. Whether it be something simple or a big change, the Lord is there to help keep
us on the right track.
